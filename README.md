How It Works
1. User Authentication:
Users can sign up or log in using their email and password via Firebase Authentication.
Authentication ensures that each userâ€™s financial data is secure and personalized.
2. Income & Expense Tracking:
Users can add income and expense transactions, including the amount, category, and date.
The data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore, linked to the authenticated user's account.
3. Viewing Transactions:
The application displays a list of all transactions. Users can view, edit, or delete individual transactions as needed.
4. Line Chart Visualization:
The app uses Chart.js to display income and expense trends over time in a dynamic line chart.
The chart is updated in real-time as users add, update, or delete transactions.
5. Using Axios for API Requests:
Axios is used to make HTTP requests to Firebase's Firestore database for fetching and storing user transaction data.
